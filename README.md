MouseTerm
=========

MouseTerm is a [SIMBL][1] plugin for Mac OS X's [Terminal.app][2] that passes
mouse events to the terminal, allowing you to use mouse shortcuts within
applications that support them.

To get started, first install [SIMBL][1] (MouseTerm won't work without it!).
Once you've done that, open the `.dmg` file, run `Install`, and restart
Terminal.app. To uninstall, run `Uninstall` from the `.dmg`.

Status
------

MouseTerm is currently alpha quality software. Some features have not yet
been implemented, and there may be bugs in the current implementation.

What works:

* Mouse button reporting.
* Mouse scroll wheel reporting.
* Simulated mouse wheel scrolling for programs like `less` (i.e. any
  fullscreen program that uses [application cursor key mode][4]).
* A preferences dialog and terminal profile integration.

What's being worked on:

* A nicer preferences dialog.

Frequently Asked Questions
--------------------------

> What programs can I use the mouse in?

This varies widely and depends on the specific program. `less`, [Emacs][5],
and [Vim][6] are good places to test out mouse reporting.

> How do I disable mouse reporting temporarily?

Use "Send Mouse Events" in the Shell menu.

> How do I configure mouse reporting on a profile basis?

In the preferences dialog under Settings, you can configure terminal
profiles. Select the profile you want to configure, go to the Keyboard
section, and click the "Mouse..." button to change what mouse buttons
are reported to programs in the terminal.

> How do I enable mouse reporting in Vim?

To enable the mouse for all modes add the following to your `~/.vimrc` file:

    if has("mouse")
        set mouse=a
    endif

Run `:help mouse` for more information and other possible values.

> What about enabling it in Emacs?

By default MouseTerm will use simulated mouse wheel scrolling in Emacs. To
enable terminal mouse support, add this to your `~/.emacs` file:

    (unless window-system
      (xterm-mouse-mode 1)
      (global-set-key [mouse-4] '(lambda ()
                                   (interactive)
                                   (scroll-down 1)))
      (global-set-key [mouse-5] '(lambda ()
                                   (interactive)
                                   (scroll-up 1))))

Development
-----------

Download the official development repository using [Git][7]:

    git clone git://github.com/brodie/mouseterm.git

Run `make` to compile the plugin, and `make install` to install it into
your home directory's SIMBL plugins folder. `make test` will install
the plugin and run a second instance of Terminal.app for testing.

Visit [GitHub][8] if you'd like to fork the project, watch for new changes,
or report issues.

[JRSwizzle][9] and some mouse reporting code from [iTerm][10] are used in
MouseTerm. [Ragel][11] is used for parsing control codes.
